# A Single-view Metrology System

Our project focus on implementing a practical software product that can create 3D model from single 2D pictures, or say, single-view metrology. We will take one high definition image as input, recognize the space structure, generating the corresponding 3D models with appropriate textures, and render images for the model as output.

Developing Tool: Matlab
